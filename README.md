My senior capstone project
In the comman terminal make sure to do http-server to run it on a http server
ou may need to have it globally installed on your device so if that is the case 
use npm install -g http-server. This requires node project manager.
After doing that you can access the links with ctrl and clicking the link.
CLick the link than click home.mhtl and click create spreadsheet.
it also works for localhost and the port but the home.html spreadsheet is the focus.
